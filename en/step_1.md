# Connecting the camera module to the Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi camera module can be used to take high-definition video, as well as still photographs.

To use the camera module, you will first need to connect it to your Raspberry Pi.

1. The flex cable of the camera inserts into the connector between the Ethernet and HDMI ports, with the silver connectors facing the HDMI port. 

1. The flex cable connector should be opened by pulling the tabs on the top of the connector upwards then towards the Ethernet port. 

1. The flex cable should be inserted firmly into the connector, with care taken not to bend the flex at too acute an angle.

1. The top part of the connector should then be pushed towards the HDMI connector and down, while the flex cable is held in place.
